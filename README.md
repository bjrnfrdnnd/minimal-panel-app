# minimal-panel-app
A pedagogical implementation of panel apps served up on a remote machine.

See the full app [here](http://minimal-panel-app.herokuapp.com/minimal-panel).

## why this project exists

I spent a day figuring out how to make this happen at work,
and decided to spend an evening consolidating my knowledge.

## anything else interesting?

The app was coded up entirely on an iPad,
using a combination of [blink](http://blink.sh)
[Juno](jhttp://juno.sh),
and `nano` on my home remote server
(which is nothing more than a converted gaming tower).

Web app development in Python is now doable
and we can use modern tablets as a thin client!
